            <h4>The Birth of Experimental Photography Techniques</h4>

            <p>When analysing how to do Experimental Photography, we must look back in time at its origins. In history, the avant-gardes have always been exploring and experimenting to create unorthodox art. Experimental Photography was not recognized as an established art form until after World War I, when the art movement Dada was born. Dadaism was found in Zurich, Switzerland in 1915, developed to reject monarchy, militarism and conservatism. Dada artists believed that art should be without restrictions or boundaries, that art can be playful, unusual and free of limits. Many works portrayed irrationality, nonsense or protesting against violence, war and certain political aspects. Anti-art genres such as Futurism, Cubism, Expressionism, Collage and Abstract Art paved the way for the movement to detach from traditional definitions. The movement remains strong today as many artists find dissatisfaction in “accepted” art forms, seeking their own freedom through Experimental Photography. </p>

            <h4>Experimental Photography in History</h4>

            <p>In Renaissance Art, humans or objects were already depicted through a highly stylized lens and the notion of enhancing the body, nature, or architecture stems back much further. Enhanced color use, choreographed poses are often used to convey artistic messages. The first Photographs that were manipulated dated back in the mid 1800s, when a Photograph of John C. Calhoun was altered by stitching on the head of Abraham Lincoln. Later in the 1840s, during Calvert Richard Jones’ trip to Malta, he Photographed a group of Capuchin friars clustered together. However, dissatisfied with the figure of a man lurking in the background, Jones painted over the negative with Indian ink. When the Photograph was printed out, the man in the back blended it perfectly into the white sky. In the 1910s, studios offered services to edit in people who were absent from group portraits. Photo manipulation and retouching grew bigger throughout the 20th century, especially when technology was introduced. 

            In 1916, Vortographs were created by Photo-Secessionist Alvin Langdon Coburn, where no subject matter is recognisable, proving that Photographs can be just as abstract as art. His works also reflected his interest in Cubism. Photograms – Photographs made without the use of a camera, but rather by exposing objects placed on Photographic papers to light was especially popular among the Dadaists. American Dadaist, Man Ray personalized Photograms into his own “Rayographs”, reinforcing the Dada essence of anti-art by emphasising abstraction. He published his series of Rayographs in December 1922, then released a film in 1923  Le Retour à la Raison ('Return to Reason') with adaption of Rayographs techniques.  Adam Fuss, Susan Derges and Christian Marclay are established artists today that still utilise photograms in their works. </p>
